        When we experience things that move us, the next thing we want is to
        find others who'll share it with us.

      <ul style="width: 100%">
        <li>It's hard to refer to a specific part of a track</li>
        <li>It requires leaving one app for another to listen</li>

          It's hard to collate and understand the collective experience of many
          for a given track

        What if there was a better way for music lovers to share the music that
        moves them?<br />A central place, tightly integrated with your music
        streaming service, which gives you the tools to talk about your music
        accurately and share it with others.<br /><br />

        It's as if your personal Spotify account and Twitter had a baby
      </h3>
      <p class="big-text" style="width: 100%">And here's how it works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Connect your <span style="color: #1db954">Spotify</span> account to
          sheer wonder
        </li>
        <li>Find a track that's special to you</li>
        <li>Isolate a segment</li>
        <li>Share a thought</li>
        <li>
          Follow and interact with others who do the same. (Or keep your account
          private and watch)
        </li>
        <li>
          Follow the tracks in your playlists to see what people are saying
          about them
        </li>
        <li>
          Create stories - playlists that have an added layer of context,
          curation and storytelling around the music that makes them.
        </li>
      </ul>
